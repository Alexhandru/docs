title: Collect Fees
---

### Setup

See the [setup guide](./00-setup-liquidity.mdx)

# Guide

In order to collect fees, the integrator must execute encoded actions
using the `PositionManager` contract.

### 1. Import and define `IPositionManager`

```solidity
import {IPositionManager} from "v4-periphery/src/interfaces/IPositionManager.sol";
// inside a contract, test, or foundry script:
IPositionManager posm = IPositionManager(<address>);
```

### 2. Encode actions

To collect fees, only the *decrease* operation is required.

```solidity
import {Actions} from "v4-periphery/src/libraries/Actions.sol";
bytes memory actions = abi.encode(Actions.DECREASE_LIQUIDITY);
```

### 3. Encode Parameters

The `DECREASE_LIQUIDITY` action requires the following parameters:

| Parameter    | Type      | Description                                                                   |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenId`    | _uint256_ | position identifier                                                           |
| `liquidity`  | _uint256_ | the amount of liquidity to withdraw                                           |
| `amount0Min` | _uint128_ | the minimum amount of currency0 liquidity msg.sender is expecting to get back |
| `amount1Min` | _uint128_ | the minimum amount of currency1 liquidity msg.sender is expecting to get back |
| `hookData`   | _bytes_   | arbitrary data that will be forwarded to hook functions                       |

**Note** that in order to collect fees we will default `liquidity`, `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` to 0.
These parameters need to be properly set when actual liquidity needs to be withdrawn.

```solidity
bytes[] memory params = abi.encode(tokenId, 0, 0, 0, hookData);
```

### 4. Submit Call

The entrypoint for all liquidity operations is `modifyLiquidities()`.

```solidity
uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 60;
posm.modifyLiquidities(
    abi.encode(actions, params),
    deadline
);
```

## Additional notes:

* To obtain the amount of fees received, callers should read
token balances before and after the `.modifyLiquidities()` call.
