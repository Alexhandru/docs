title: Create Pool
---

In order to create a pool, the *initialize* function needs to be called
in the `PoolManager`. Let's have a look at its interface.

```solidity
    function initialize(PoolKey memory key, uint160 sqrtPriceX96, bytes calldata hookData)
        external
        returns (int24 tick);
```

The *key* parameter is a struct that uniquely identifies a pool and has the
following attributes:

```solidity
struct PoolKey {
    /// @notice The lower currency of the pool, sorted numerically
    Currency currency0;
    /// @notice The higher currency of the pool, sorted numerically
    Currency currency1;
    /// @notice The pool LP fee, capped at 1_000_000. If the highest bit is 1, the pool has a dynamic fee and must be exactly equal to 0x800000
    uint24 fee;
    /// @notice Ticks that involve positions must be a multiple of tick spacing
    int24 tickSpacing;
    /// @notice The hooks of the pool
    IHooks hooks;
}
```

The *sqrtPriceX96* parameter dictates the starting price of the pool.

The *hookData* parameter is used to pass arbitrary data to the hook contract.
This data can then be used to further customise behaviour when a pool is initialized.
